Demeter is the center of
an extremely important mystery cult centered in the city of
Eleusis (in your campaign, this
city and its cult might carry a different name). The central myth of this cult, far more important
than any tales of Zeus’s escapades or the labors of Hercules, is the
story of Demeter’s daughter, Persephone, and her abduction by
Hades.
According to this myth, Zeus gave Hades permission to take
Persephone as his wife, which he did by kidnapping her as she
gathered flowers with her friends. Her carried her into the underworld and made her his bride. Hearing Persephone’s cries of distress, Demeter ran off in search of her daughter, searching the earth for nine days before learning that Hades had taken her.
Upon learning Persephone’s fate, Demeter went into mourning, wandering listlessly until she came to Eleusis. There, disguised as an old woman, she entered the household of the king,
Keleos, and reared his infant son, Demophoön. She anointed
the baby with ambrosia and tucked him into the blazing fire at
night, planning to make him immortal. His mother, Metaneira,
discovered the baby in the fire and cried out, not realizing
what Demeter was doing. Angered, Demeter left
the household and ordered a temple to be built
in her honor in the city.
She brooded in that temple, preventing any
crops from growing on the earth, for a year.
Finally, by ordering Persephone to be brought
up from Hades, Zeus persuaded Demeter
to rejoin the company of gods on
Olympus. Because Persephone
accepted food (a single pomegranate seed) in the underworld, she was bound by the
laws of hospitality to
return there. By Zeus’s
decree, Persephone was
to spend one -third of
the year in the underworld with Hades, and
the remaining two -
thirds in Olympus
with the other gods.
While Persephone
remains in the underworld, Demeter mourns
and the earth bears no
fruit. For the rest of the
year, Demeter allows crops
to grow and flourish.
This myth is the fundamental doctrine of the
Eleusinian Mysteries, but
even more important are the
series of rites performed in
the Mysteries that recreate
the myth as a personal
experience for each initiate.
The initiates dance and celebrate as Persephone gathers
flowers; then word comes that
Persephone has been abducted,
and all revelry ceases. Carrying
torches, the initiates act the
role of Demeter searching
for her daughter. In the
central act of the rite, the
initiates identify with
Demophoön, nurtured in Demeter’s arms
and primed for immortality. They reenact
descending to the underworld with Persephone and
rising to Olympus with Demeter. Demeter’s avatar is said to
appear to the initiates and bestow her blessing upon them at the
climax of the ritual. Initiates of the Mysteries live their lives
under Demeter’s blessing. They believe that when they die, they
will not become mere shades in Hades, but will dwell on Olympus with Demeter in eternal bliss.
The rituals of the Mysteries are utterly secret. No initiate may
speak of what occurs in the inner sanctum of the temple during
the rites, under penalty of death.

============================================================

Dionysus’s mystery cult teaches a secret myth about the deity’s
origin, supposedly passed on to mortals by the epic bard
Orpheus. Zeus and Demeter’s daughter Persephone had a dalliance that resulted in the birth of a deity named Zagreus. Hera,
in a jealous rage, sent some Titans from Tartarus to kill the child
god. Zagreus tried to escape by shapechanging into various
forms—Zeus, Cronus, a young man, a lion, a horse, a serpent and
finally a bull. Catching him in his bull form, the Titans tore his body apart
and ate it. Before they could finish their grisly meal, Zeus
appeared and incinerated them with bolts of lightning, rescuing
Zagreus’s heart and forming humanity from the ashes of the
Titans. Because the Titans had consumed Zagreus, some of his
divine nature remained in their ashes, forming a “divine spark”
deep inside human nature.
Zeus then gave Zagreus’s heart to Semele. Some legends say that
she ate the heart, while others say Zeus used it to make a potion
that impregnated her. In any event, Dionysus was born as a result.
Thus, Dionysus’s origin remains true to the common mythology
that calls him a son of Zeus and Semele, but it also makes him a
reincarnation of Zagreus.
Semele also died as a result of Hera’s jealousy. Hera
tricked Semele into persuading Zeus to
reveal his divine splendor to her, but her
mortal frame could not withstand his
glory and she disintegrated
into ash. The child in her
womb, being half divine,
survived, and a vine
grew from her ashes
to shield the infant
Dionysus. Zeus took
the child and sewed
him into his own thigh
where he finished his gestation. As a result of this remarkable birth, Dionysus is known as
the twice-born.
As an adult, Dionysus discovered
wine and shared that mixed blessing
with mortals. He also descended into the
underworld to find his mother, Semele, and
brought her up to dwell with him in Olympus as
an immortal. (Orpheus, too, descended into the
underworld to find a loved one, his wife, but
was unable to bring her back to the
mortal world.)
The Orphic Mysteries of Dionysus, like
Demeter’s mystery cult, allow initiates to reenact
this complicated mythic history, becoming
participants in Dionysus-Zagreus’s life, death,
and rebirth. As in the cult of Demeter, initiates in
the mysteries believe they meet Dionysus or his
avatar firsthand, in a ritual in which they symbolically
die to their old lives and rise again to new lives. After their initiation, they enjoy a life of carefree celebration and orgiastic
frenzy, and they look forward to life with Dionysus-Zagreus in
Olympus after their death.
